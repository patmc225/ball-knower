I've updated the navigation tabs to be more mobile-friendly.

### Changes:
- **Full Width Layout**: Tabs now stretch to fill the screen width evenly (`flex-1`).
- **Responsive Text**: Font size is reduced to `text-sm` on mobile to fit "LEADERBOARD" and "PROFILE" without scrolling, while remaining `text-2xl` on desktop.
- **Compact Padding**: Reduced padding on mobile devices to maximize available space.
- **No Scrolling**: Removed the horizontal scroll behavior so all tabs are visible at once.
